This post is essentially a reference to [my month-old tweets](https://twitter.com/__c1own/status/1102202355376943104?s=20). 

After 2008, Taleb also [spoke](http://nassimtaleb.org/2010/06/nassim-taleb-speaks-to-congress-value-at-risk-var/) to Congress about the risks of using VaR. (Ignore the description under the video.) You can see the full hearing [here](https://youtu.be/40Gkp0wJplU). More generally, see the [Criticism section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk#Criticism) on VaR's Wikipedia page.
