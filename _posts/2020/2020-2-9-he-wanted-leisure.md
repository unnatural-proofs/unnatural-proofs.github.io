> What he wanted, Ramanujan replied, was a pittance on which to live and work. Or, as Ramachandra Rao later put it, "He wanted leisure, in other words, simple food to be provided to him without exertion on his part, and that he should be allowed to dream on." <cite>Robert Kanigel. The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan. p. 81</cite>

Making slides on my [last paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10503), I chanced upon David Deutsch's paper

> Deutsch, David. "Quantum theory, the Church–Turing principle and the universal quantum computer." Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. A. Mathematical and Physical Sciences 400, no. 1818 (1985): 97-117. DOI: [10.1098/rspa.1985.0070](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1985.0070)

and skimming through it reminded me of the above quote from Ramanujan.

I don't know if I want to add more context, it is beautiful as is. I miss research... Alright, alright, here is some context. I haven't been doing full-time research for a while now, my last full-time stint was at the end of 2018. So, yeah, I've been *research-free since '18* ([the reference](https://youtu.be/YxHFOh3t8mk) for my non-HIMYM readers.) If you clicked on the link at the top of this post, you'll know that I am still reading and writing papers. In fact, the paper I am most proud of is the aforementioned [last paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10503). So, yeah, part-time research hasn't been too bad to me. In fact, part-time research has been a lot less stressful. But, sometimes, I yearn for "leisure." Of course, I am not comparing myself to the amazing Ramanujan, who kinda surprisingly also did a lot of his initial awesome work while he was working as a Accounting Clerk at the Madras Port Trust. Man, I have a lot of appreciation for Ramanujan, he did a lot of his early work with almost no encouragement and no access to papers, or even textbooks! Original research is hard as-is with a well-stocked library and world-class researchers guiding you, but to have to endure it without the support system must have had a huge mental toil on him. Anyway, enough rambling. I think STOC announcements are due tomorrow---congratulations in advance.
