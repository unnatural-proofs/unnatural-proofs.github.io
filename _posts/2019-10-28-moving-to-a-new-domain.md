unnatural-proofs is moving to a domain!! I initially structured unnatural-proofs
as a GitHub organization with the expectation that this would eventually be
a group blog. But, with
[all](https://unnatural-proofs.github.io/2018/quantum-vs-classical/)
[my](https://unnatural-proofs.github.io/2019/quantum-computers-could-not-have-prevented-2008/)
[rants](https://unnatural-proofs.github.io/2019/more-tweets-quantum-economics/),
it quickly turned into a personal blog. Now I am formally turning this into
a personal blog by moving it to my GitHub account. All existing posts will
remain on this website, but new posts will only appear on the new blog. Oh,
I almost forgot, the new url for this blog is
[`c1own.com/blog/`](https://c1own.com/blog/).
