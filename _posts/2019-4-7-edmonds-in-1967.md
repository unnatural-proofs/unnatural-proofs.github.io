I conjecture that there is no good algorithm for the traveling salesman problem.  My reasons are the same as for any mathematical conjecture: (1) It is a legitimate mathematical possibility, and (2) I  do not know.

I have seen this quote many times (it appears in â€ŽPapadimitriou and Arora and Barak) but I haven't read the source till today. I highly recommend anything by Edmonds, he is awesome. If you want to read just one paper: check out [Paths, Trees, and Flowers](https://doi.org/10.4153/CJM-1965-045-4). 

If you are wondering, I still don't believe that $\P = \NP \cap \coNP$. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised if every combinatorial problem that is currently in $\NP \cap \coNP$---you could call this class $\EdmondsP$---turns out to be in $\P$. $\EdmondsP$, for instance, would include graph isomorphism, which I strongly believe is in $\P$. Also, if you are wondering, why this does not imply $\P = \NP \cap \coNP$---after all, if all combinatorial problems in $\NP$ are in $\P$, then $\P=\NP$---it is because we don't believe that $\NP \cap \coNP$ has complete problems (Sipster [constructed](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0012797) a relativized world where this holds.)
